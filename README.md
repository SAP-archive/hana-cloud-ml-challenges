# Hands-On Tutorial: Leverage SAP HANA Machine Learning in the Cloud through the Predictive Analysis Library

## Description

The hard truth is that many machine learning projects fail to get set into production. It takes time and real effort to move from a machine learning model to a real business application. This is due to many different reasons for example: 
1.	Limited data access
2.	Poor data quality
3.	Small computing power 
4.	No version control
Of course, we canâ€™t save the world with just one Hands-On tutorial, but we can at least try to make the life of a data scientist a little easier. In this blog post we will tackle these challenges by bringing the opensource world and SAP world together. In a nutshell, there will be no movement of training data from SAP HANA Cloud to our Python environment. 

## Requirements

In order to "run" the provided sample codes, a SAP HANA database environment is required with the AFL-component installed, which includes the Predictive Analysis Library (PAL). Specific sample files will specify additional requirements if required.

## Download and Installation

The sample files can be downloaded and used within the respective user / developer environment, e.g. Python files may be opened and used within Jupyter Notebooks. The sample files don't require a install step for themselves, they are simply downloaded and then opened in the respective editor.
